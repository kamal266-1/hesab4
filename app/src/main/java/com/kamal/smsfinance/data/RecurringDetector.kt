/**
 * Pure, DB-free detector: groups an in-memory list of transactions by
 * (bank, type) and walks consecutive pairs looking for a monthly or
 * biweekly cadence with a close-enough amount -- covers bills,
 * installments ("قسط"), and recurring payments like rent/salary whose
 * amount can drift slightly month to month. Tolerant of one missed month.
 *
 * Deliberately stateless and DB-free: "recurring" is derived data, so it is
 * computed on demand from the current transaction list rather than stored
 * on the Transaction row (Single Source of Truth). This also makes it
 * trivially unit-testable with a plain list, no Room/Android dependency.
